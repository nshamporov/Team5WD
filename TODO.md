1. Edit Login/ Register buttons

2. On the Register page make functionality to add the account to an array (kinda like database but we will use array) and make it that after Sign Up button is pressed user goes to home page.

3. On the Login page make functionality to check if user exist (if its possible to do in JS we can make it to go through the array of users and if user exist go to home page and if it doesnt we can give error message).
